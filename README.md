## What is does:
### Our OO Library API parses JSON data from the pokeapi.co database. It GETs both the names and corresponding types of various pokemon and matches a given pokemon with the types it is strongest and weakest against.

## How to use: 
### The functionality of this API is to help a beginner at Pokemon with best and worst matchups. The user will be able to enter their Pokemon of choice, and our API will send requests to the PokeAPI from PokeAPI.co to return a Pokemon that is a good matchup and a Pokemon that is a poor matchup against the given Pokemon. 

## Testing: Multiple test cases have been added to our test.py file. To test run 
```
python3 test_api.py
```
